# PhyPiDAQ

Data Acquisition and analysis for Physics education with Raspberry Pi

This is the **english** Version of the documentation.

For German readers:  
Die **deutsche Version** dieses Dokuments findet sich unter dem Link [README_de.md](README_de.md).


This *python3*  code provides some basic functionality for data acquisition and visualisation like data logger, bar-chart, XY- or oscilloscope display and data recording on disk.  

In addition to the GPIO inputs/outputs of the Raspberry Pi, the analog-to-digital converters ADS1115 and MCP3008 and PicoScope USB-oscilloscopes are supported as input devices for analog data, as well as a number of digital sensors using protocols like IÂ²C or SPI.

The package provides an abstraction layer for measurement devices and sensors connected to a Raspberry Pi.  Dedicated classes for each device provide a simple, unified interface, containing only the methods `init(<config_dictionary>)`, `acquireData(buffer)` and `close()`. Simple examples with minimalist code illustrate the usage. The graphical user interface `phypi.py` and the script `run_phypi.py` provide a configurable environment for more complex measurements.

## Quick-start guide

After installation - see below - a number of unified classes for data acquisition, visualisation and recording is available from the sub-directory `./phypidaq`.
Each supported device needs a specific configuration, which is read from configuration files in sub-directory `./config`. The overall configuration is given in files of type `.daq`, specifying which devices and display modules to use, the readout rate, calibrations or analytical formulae to be applied to recorded data, or ranges and axis labels of the graphical output. 

The graphical user interface `phypi.py` aids in the administration of the configuration options and can be used to start data acquisition. In this case, configurations and produced data files are stored in a dedicated sub-directory in `$HOME/PhyPi`. The name is derived from a user-defined tag and the current date and time.

Data acquisition may also be started via the command line:

    run_phypi.py <config_file_name>.daq

If no configuration file is given, the default `PhyPiConf.daq` is used.

The sub-directory `./examples` contains a number of simple *python* scripts illustrating the usage of data acquisition and display modules with minimalist code.

## Configuration

The script ``run_phypi.py` allows users to perform very general measurement tasks without the need to write custom code. The options for configuration of input devices and their channels as well as for the display and data storage modules are specified in a global configuration file of type `.daq` (in `yaml` markup language), which contains references to device configuration files of type `.yaml`.

A typical, commented example is shown here:

**file PhyPiConf.daq**

    #CSVseparator: ';'            # field separator for output file, defaults to ','
    

The device configuration file for the analog-to-digital converter **ADS1115**
specifies the active channels, their ranges and single or differential operation modes.

**file ADS1115Config.yaml**

```yaml
# example of a configuration file for ADC ADS1115

DAQModule: ADS1115Config    # phypidaq module to be loaded

ADCChannels: [0, 3]         # active ADC-Channels
                        # possible values: 0, 1, 2, 3
                        # when using differential mode:
                        #    -  0 = ADCChannel 0 
                        #            minus ADCChannel 1
                        #    -  1 = ADCChannel 0 
                        #            minus ADCChannel 3
                        #    -  2 = ADCChannel 1 
                        #            minus ADCChannel 3
                        #    -  3 = ADCChannel 2 
                        #            minus ADCChannel 3

DifModeChan: [true, true] # enable differential mode for Channels

Gain: [2/3, 2/3]          # programmable gain of ADC-Channel
                          #   possible values for Gain:
                          #     - 2/3 = +/-6.144V
                          #     -   1 = +/-4.096V
                          #     -   2 = +/-2.048V
                          #     -   4 = +/-1.024V
                          #     -   8 = +/-0.512V
                          #     -  16 = +/-0.256V
sampleRate: 860           # programmable Sample Rate of ADS1115
                          #    possible values for SampleRate: 
                          #    8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 250, 475, 860
```

The **USB-oscilloscpe** PicoScope can also be used as data logger.
In this case the average of a large number of measurements at
high rate is take. Choosing a measurement time of 20 ms very
effectively eliminates 50 Hz noise. 

** file PSconfig.yaml**

```yaml
# example of a configuration file for PicoScope 2000 Series

DAQModule: PSConfig

PSmodel: 2000a

# channel configuration 
picoChannels: [A, B]
ChanRanges: [2., 2.]
ChanOffsets: [-1.95, -1.95]
ChanModes: [DC, DC]
sampleTime: 2.0E-02
Nsamples: 100

# oscilloscope trigger
trgActive: false  # true to activate
trgChan: A
#trgThr: 0.1
#pretrig: 0.05
#trgTyp: Rising
#trgTO: 1000  # time-out

# internal signal generator 
# frqSG: 100.E+3 # put 0. do disable

```

Examples for other devices like the analog-to-digital converter MCP3008, for
rate measurements via the GPIO pins of the Raspberry Pi or temperature
measurements with PT100 sensors and the resistance-to-digital converter
MAX31865 are also contained in the configuration directory, see files
`MCP3008Config.yaml`, `GPIOcount.yaml` or `MAX31865Config.yaml`, respectively.

## Installation

This package relies on code from other packages providing the drivers for the supported devices:

```html
- the Adafruit Pyhon MCP3008 library
     <https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_MCP3008>
- the Adafruit Python ADX1x15 library
     <https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_ADS1x15>
- components from the picoDAQ project  
     <https://github.com/GuenterQuast/picoDAQ>
- the  *python* bindings of the *pico-python* project by Colin O'Flynn  
     <https://github.com/colinoflynn/pico-python> and
- the low-level drivers contained in the Pico Technology Software Development Kit 
    <https://www.picotech.com/downloads>
```

For convenience, installation files for external packages in pip wheel format are provided in sub-directory *./whl*.

The visualization modules depend on *matplotlib.pyplot*, *Tkinter* and *pyQt5*, which must also be installed.

After setting up your Raspberry Pi with the actual stable Debian release *stretch*, the following steps should be taken to update and install all necessary packages:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get install python3-scipy
sudo apt-get install python3-matplotlib
sudo apt-get install python3-pyqt5

sudo pip3 install pyyaml

# PicoTech base drivers for picoScope USB devices
#   see https://www.picotech.com/support/topic14649.html
# after inclusion of the picotech raspbian repository:  
sudo apt-get install libps2000a
# allow access of user pi to usb port
sudo usermod -a -G tty pi

# get PhyPiDAQ code and dependencies
mkdir git
cd git
git clone https://GuenterQuast/PhyPiDAQ
cd PhyPicDAQ/whl
sudo pip3 install *.whl
```
